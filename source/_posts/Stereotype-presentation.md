# About Stereotype
> The second sharing session in the convergence run. 
  记在汇流的第二次分享

## Preface
   The theme of this sharing is Stereotype, inspired by a shared theme of the English Corner, which talks about the influence of Stereotype on people's lives, and what kind of attitude we should use to face and deal with the impact of it, give me A great inspiration.
   
   这次分享的主题是Stereotype，灵感来自一次英语角的分享主题，其中讲到的Stereotype对人们生活的影响，以及我们应该用什么样的态度去面对并处理它所带来影响，给我产生了很大的启发。

## What is a stereotype
In social psychology, a stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular category of people. Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category.
 
## The impact On Life
### Directly judge some nouns/a class of people

- Middle-aged Men
- People with tattoos
- Programmer

#### What kinds of stereotypes do you have of them?

Any way, I believe many people will immediately associate many bad adjectives. But have you ever thought that we often just remember their embarrassing side and never remember the side that they should be respected for?

#### For example:
People often think that middle-aged men are, greasy, lazy, love to preach. But Have you ever thought about that some of these people are already fathers, Some are the backbone of the company. In addition to supporting the family, they must continue to develop.
